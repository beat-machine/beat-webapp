# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

This project doesn't use Semantic Versioning because it's ultimately
user-facing and can't be used as a library. Instead, date-based versions
(YY.MM.revision) are used.
